# Up and Running with TypeScript

Are you interested in using TypeScript on an existing or new project? Are you unsure of how to get started? Have you struggled to get your toolchain setup properly? Come join us for a hands-on workshop, where we'll work with you to get up and running with TypeScript!

If you're already using TypeScript, join Ken and James with helping others get setup. Everybody is welcome :)

Bring your laptop and get ready to TypeScript!
